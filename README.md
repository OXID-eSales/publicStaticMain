Refactoring Task
================

The Domain
----------

A dealer is selling screws. At this time there is a variable discount (depending on discount type)
in case a customer buys at least 20 screws of the same kind.
The bill is generated by this small program here, currently only as text output to console.

The Task
--------

The dealer "I'm dealer, not a developer" needs your help. To make sure the program can be used in the long term, the
dealer wants it to be able to create the bill in different output formats, e.g. HTML. Unfortunately the original
developer is long gone and nobody is familiar with the code anymore.

You have 30 minutes time to look over the code. Don't delve into  too much
details in the beginning, but try to get an overview what the code does. It
is completely working: You may run the publicStaticMain.php script and see
the expected output.

Then try to identify problems with the code - there are several levels
on which this code is bad. You need not to rewrite it now, but just note
down, what you would change and then we will talk about the proposed
changes afterwards.
