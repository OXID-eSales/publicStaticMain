Refactoring Task
================

The Domain
----------

A dealer is selling screws. At this time there is a variable discount (depending on discount type)
in case a customer buys at least 20 screws of the same kind.
The bill is generated by this small program here, currently only as text output to console.

The Task
--------

The dealer "I'm dealer, not a developer" needs your help. To make sure the program can be used in the long term, the
dealer wants it to be able to create the bill in different output formats, e.g. HTML. Unfortunately the original
developer is long gone and nobody is familiar with the code anymore.

You have 60 minutes of time, of course this is very limited and you won't be able to refactor all of the code so
prioritize. Focus on the ability to provide different output formats, but you only need to implement it for the console
output. Make sure the program is able to run when you are done.

We like spaghetti, but only at lunch time, not as code. So whatever you touch, keep in mind that your changed code
must improve maintainability, readability and testability.

If you have further ideas on how you would refactor the code but there is no time left to implement it put them at the
end of this document. We would love to see that you have an eye for the "bigger picture".

The publicStaticMain.php script is an example of how to run the code and what to expect as output.
