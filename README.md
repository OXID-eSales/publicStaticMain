This is an example task for testing your development skills.

A dealer is selling screws. At this time there is a variable discount (depending on discount type)
in case a customer buys at least 20 screws of the same kind.
The bill is generated by this small program here, currently only as text output to console.

To make sure the program can be used in the long term, the dealer wants it to be able to
create the bill in different output formats, e.g. HTML. Unfortunately the original developer is long gone,
and nobody is familiar with the code any more. The dealer "I'm dealer, not a developer" needs your help
to ensure that the code is clean, maintainable, extendable, stable and well tested.

The smallprint:

This code is not state of the art. Take your time (app. 60 min) and think about the ways to improve this code.
Describe the changes or better, do change this code to improve maintainability, readability and testability.
Think about clean, well testable and documented code. We like spaghetti, but only at lunch time, not as code.

The publicStaticMain.php script is an example of how to run the code and what to expect as output.
